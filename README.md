# Cryptography Project - 2nd Semester Computer Science

In this semestral project, we have to implement a cryptography method using Python.

We implemented XOR cryptography. In this method, both the text and the key are converted to their corresponding ASCII values. Then, it's necessary to convert these ASCII values to binary. For this, we use a truth table to perform a bit-by-bit XOR operation on the text that corresponds to the key. After the XOR operation, the generated number will correspond to a number in the ASCII table, thus producing the encrypted word.
